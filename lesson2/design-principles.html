                    <h3>Steam</h3>
                    <p id="desc">The sales page does a wonderful job with repetition by having a uniform look across the
                        discounts
                        and sales prices of each game. All the games in this section are the same size, the percentages
                        have the same color and typeface, and the discounts all share a similar feel of showing an
                        original price and a discounted price.</p>

                    <h3>Minecraft</h3>
                    <p id="desc">The home page of Minecraft follows the rule of thirds very well by having the main
                        text, "WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL SITE OF MINECRAFT", aligned with the top third line, where the
                        user's eyes are most likely to go first. Then on the bottom third line, there's a button to
                        purchase and download the game.</p>

                    <h3>Minecraft</h3>
                    <p id="desc">The home page of Chess.com, LLC has a contrasting color scheme that makes it easy to
                        see where things are and what's important. They have a dark colored background with white text,
                        and an accent colorto highlight the log in button and the button to start a chess game.</p>
