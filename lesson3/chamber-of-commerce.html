        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a design planning document for a larger website about the Valley
            Floor Chamber
            of Commerce. It provides an overview of the organization, including its demographics as well as
            information on the design elements such as color scheme and font choices. The site is divided into three
            pages, each
            with a specific focus. The first page provides general information about the Valley Floor Chamber of
            Commerce, the
            second page is dedicated to persona cards and demographic information, and the last page provides detailed
            design
            information, including the color scheme and fonts. This site serves as a guide for the design and
            development of the
            larger website, and it is intended to be used by the website development team to ensure a cohesive and
            effective design.</p>
